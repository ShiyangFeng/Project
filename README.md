Hi there! My name is Shiyang Feng, welcome to my repo! I'm a recent Master graduate from NYU with a concentration on database technology, and also an alumini from General Assembly's Data Science Immersive program. 





## introduction

*This is a central repo for Shiyang Feng's data science project. It serves as a review of finished project and as a reflection on my path to become a data scientist. I will, in this repo, document each project's code and results using Jupyter Notebook. I will keep updating this repo, and you are welcome to fork and create your own branch. **Python 2x is used for all projects***

First of all, Data Science is one of the hottest topics on the Computer and Internet farmland nowadays. People have gathered data from applications and systems until today and now is the time to analyze them. The next steps are producing suggestions from the data and creating predictions about the future. [Here](https://www.quora.com/Data-Science/What-is-data-science) you can find the biggest question for **Data Science** and hundreds of answers from experts. Our favorite data scientist is [Clare Corthell](https://twitter.com/clarecorthell). She is an expert in data-related systems and a hacker, and has been working on a company as a data scientist. [Clare's blog](http://datasciencemasters.org/). This web site helps you to understand the exact way to study as a professional data scientist.

Secondly, Our favorite programming language is *Python* nowadays for #DataScience. Python's - [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) library has full functionality for collecting and analyzing data. We use [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) to play with data and to create applications. 

This is the [Guide](https://github.com/okulbilisim/awesome-datascience/blob/master/DataScience-Life-Cycle.md) to begin a **Data Science** project.
