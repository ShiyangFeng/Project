Hi there! My name is Shiyang Feng, welcome to my repo! I'm a recent Master graduate from NYU with a concentration on database technology, and also an alumini from General Assembly's Data Science Immersive program (Here's my [GA Profile](https://profiles.generalassemb.ly/shiyangfeng)). 

My major in college was General Finance, and what I learned had a little to do with data science. The first time that the word **data science** appeared in my life was in high school, when I read from news that a company called [Netflix](http://www.netflixprize.com) was giving out $1 million for a more accurate recommendation engine powered by data science. But at that time, I didn't really feel like knowing more about it, because it was 'nerdy' to me back then, and finance was **the thing** for me. 

I started thinking about data science as an alternate career paths after the 2008 subprime crisis, which, to some extent, pushed me away from pursuing a career as a ~~pure~~ finance person because of the extremely low job security. Therefore, I took my time and thought about what I really want to do in my life, and I came up with my own evaluation matrix for my dream job:

| | Low Business Acumen | High Business Acumen
|---|---|---|
| **Low Technical Savvy** | Not well paid | Low Job Security |
| **High Technical Savvy** | Not interested | Exactly what I want! |

In my viewpoint, a mix of technical savvy and business acumen will keep me competitive long enough, and my dream is exactly like that. In order to land my dream job, I'm actively preparing myself. 

On one hand, finishing my master degree in database technology at NYU and General Assembly's 12-week immersive trainning program on data science prepare me on the technical side of the job, which is not just about the skills needed for the job, but also the ability to extent my knowledge base on my own. 

On the other hand, my previous experiences in different organizations playing different roles enable me to think strategically to create values for businesses.

Data scientists, whose primary responsibility is to come up with right questions and answer them using different skills and tools requires exactly a combination of business acumen and technical savvy. That's why I decided to pursur a career as a data scientist.

## introduction

This is a central repo for Shiyang Feng's data science project. It serves as a review of finished project and as a reflection on my path to become a data scientist. I will, in this repo, document each project's code and results using Jupyter Notebook. I will keep updating this repo, and you are welcome to fork and create your own branch.

When it comes to data science, one of the outstanding questions is **What is Data Science?**, and one of the most elaborative answer I found myself strongly resonate to is given by *Pronojit Saha* on [Quora](https://hail-data.quora.com/What-is-Data-Science). Saha clearly draws out the workflow of a data scientist on a high level, and he gives out a 5-step process for a data science project to be hypothesis-driven:

1. Asking right questions
2. Defining data needs
3. Identifying and implementing analysis on data
4. Communicating findings
5. Automating step 2 to 4

Throughout the carryout of all my data science projects, I strictly stick to the 5-step development process to keep my documents organized (step 5 is missing in prototyping). The programming language I used for all my projects is *Python 2.7*. [Here](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/05/r-vs-python-data-science.html) I'll bring up the unceasing discussion on **Which one is better? R or Python?**
